# Calculator Project

This project implements a simple calculator that evaluates mathematical expressions using **Rhino** as a JavaScript engine. It can evaluate expressions provided as strings (e.g., `2 + 2`, `(8-9)*7+78/7`) and return the result.

## Features

- Supports basic arithmetic operations: addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
- Dynamic evaluation of expressions provided as strings.
- Built using **Rhino** to evaluate JavaScript expressions inside a Java application.
- JUnit 5 tests for basic functionality and error handling.

## Requirements

- Java 17 or 23
- Maven (for dependency management)
